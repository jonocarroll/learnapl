Over is a function composition rule, similar to those that govern [tacit](tacit.ipynb) programming. Once you \"see\" this pattern, you'll see it everywhere. Let's take a look.\n",

    "`Over` complements jot `∘` and the atop version of `⍤` in that it specifies how a set of functions should be applied to common arguments. If we compare `f∘g` and `f⍤g`, when given a left argument, `∘` gives it to the left-hand function and `⍤` gives it to the right-hand function. Other than that, they are the same. For the monadic case, these are all the same:\n",
